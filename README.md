## TODO

 - So much trouble getting the correct native dll to copy to the build directory.
 - I can run the clroepcie-test program fine
 - I can nuget package the clroepcie library fine and I can see the native liboepcie.dll in there
 - When I run this bonsai package, the liboepcie.dll is not copied to build directory. I have to do it manually.
